# Algorithmic-Trading
Algorithmic trading using Python

This repo is based on the freecodecamp [Youtube course](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE) taught by [@nickmccullum](https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python). 

Our end goal is to build a portfolio of some special stocks and their proportions are determined by the strategy used.
We use three strategies:
- Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund
- Quantitative Momentum Strategy
- Quantitative Value Strategy

Please refer to the .ipynb notebooks for further information.
